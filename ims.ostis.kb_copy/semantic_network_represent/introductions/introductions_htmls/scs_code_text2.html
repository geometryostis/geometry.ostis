<p>The <b><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code">SCs-code</sc_element></b> is linear version of the representation  of the <sc_element sys_idtf="set">SC-code</sc_element>. The <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code">SCs-code</sc_element> is intended for the representation of sc-graphs(texts of the <sc_element sys_idtf="set">SC-code</sc_element>)   in form of symbols sequence which can be edited with means of standard text editors or with means of the specialized <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_editor">sc.s-editor</sc_element>. Therefore, one of requirements, which can be produced towards the <b><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code">SCs-code</sc_element></b>, besides completeness and consistence, is a possibility to set up source texts without assistance of the specialized editor, using only symbols of standard keyboard.</p>
<p>In contrast to the <sc_element sys_idtf="scn_code">SCn-code</sc_element>,which is also being the text version of sc-graphs mapping, formatting doesn’t matter in the <b><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code">SCs-code</sc_element></b>, all sentences could be written in one line.</p>
<p>In contrast to the <sc_element sys_idtf="scg_code">SCg-code</sc_element>, there are not special notations for indications of structural type of <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_node">SC-nodes</sc_element>, but there are images of <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connectors</sc_element>, corresponding to a kernel  and  an extension of the <sc_element sys_idtf="scg_code">SCg-code</sc_element>, as well as images of particular <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">SC-connectors</sc_element>, for which there is no match in the <sc_element sys_idtf="scg_code">SCg-code</sc_element>.</p>
<p>Technically, the <b><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code">SCs-code</sc_element></b> is the set of <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_text">sc.s-texts</sc_element>. Each <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_text">sc.s-text</sc_element> is a sequence of <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence">sc.s-sentences</sc_element>, each of which ends with the delimiter;; (double semicolon). Set of <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence">sc.s-sentences</sc_element> is divided  into the set of simple <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence">sc.s-sentences</sc_element> andthe  set  of  complex <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence">sc.s-sentences</sc_element>. Each complex <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence">sc.s-sentence</sc_element>  contains built-in sentences  in the composition. The  built-in sentences are restricted by the limiter (*…*).</p>
<p>Comments  are allowed within the <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_text">sc.s- text</sc_element>  of any level. It can be :</p>
<p>//one-line comment</p>
<p>/*multiline comment*/</p>
<p>At the beginning of the file, containing <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_text">sc.s-text</sc_element>  it is strongly recommended to specify the level and the version of the <b><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code">SCs-code</sc_element></b>. For this purpose, use the comment of a special kind:</p>
<p>/* SCs_code<"<b>version</b>">.Level<" <b>level number</b> "> */</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>/* SCs_code0.1.0.Level 6 */</p>
<p>It should be noted that the comment of the form /*...*/, used inside <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_frame">sc.s-frame</sc_element> (see the relevant section), isn’t omitted when parsing <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_text">sc.s-text</sc_element>, and becomes part of the content of the corresponding <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_link">sc-link</sc_element>. For example, when parsing a sentence</p>
<p>X =>r1: \[TEXT1/*COMMENT*/TEXT2\];;</p>
<p>Sc-link with contents TEXT1/*COMMENT*/TEXT2, ане TEXT1TEXT2 will be created.</p>
<p>The <b><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code">SCs-code</sc_element></b> is conditionally separated on 7 levels of difficulties. All the levels are equivalentto thepossibilitiesof knowledge representation, however texts of higher levels describe sc-graphs more laconically and convenient. Introduction of levels are meant to facilitate the work of the knowledge base developers at a set of <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_text">sc.s-texts</sc_element>. It is recommended that the development ofthe knowledge bases includes using levels before the six inclusive.</p>
