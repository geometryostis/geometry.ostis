<p>When there are large amounts of sc.g-texts, second level may be insufficient. As with the transition from the 1st level 2nd level, improving readability of sc.g-texts can be achieved even more substantial reduction of the depicted on the screen elements. The 3rd level of  SCg-code is entered  for this purpose.</p>
<p>Many sc.g-arcs (pairs) often issue of sc.g-node (or a large number of sc.g-arcs (pairs) is included in it).  In this case sc.g-text becomes  to read difficultly,because many sc.g-arcs (par) which can be superimposed on the text identifier is drawn around it sc.g-node. Moreover the average length of sc.g-arcs (pairs) increases in this text, it leads to difficulty in finding the start and end of elements of these sc.g-arcs (see illustration)</p>
