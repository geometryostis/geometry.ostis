<p>It is visible that the sc-node with the identifier a triangle has two accurately distinguishable characteristic: it is a constant and it is the sc-node representing the concept of non- relation. The image of this node by using the SCg-code the second level is the following:</p>

    <li>structural type(the sc-node representing the concept of non- relation) is depicted in a circle. This structure type is represented by the letter X
with a horizontal line in the middle. </li>
</ul>
