<p><b><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code_1_level">SCs-code of level 1</sc_element></b> is similar to <sc_element sys_idtf="scg_code_1_level">SCg-code of level 1</sc_element> and represent the simplest universal coding instrument (representation)of any sc-graph in a linear look  that is in the form of a chain of symbols. At the same time , each sc-element  of the sc-graph, which was represented put one-to-one with it string identifier(name),that does necessary specially to invent names for all using sc-elements forming part of the represented sc-graph.</p>
