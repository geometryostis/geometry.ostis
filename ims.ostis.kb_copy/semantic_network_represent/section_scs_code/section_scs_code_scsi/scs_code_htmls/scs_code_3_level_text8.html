<p>Note that compared with the presentation in the <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code_2_level">SC.s-2 level-code</sc_element>, the sample contains fewer <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence">sc.s-sentences</sc_element>, because several <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence_2_level">sc.s-2 level sentence</sc_element> can be combined into a <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence_3_level">sc.s-3 level sentence</sc_element>. Also in this example, there are no limits ( ), the removal of which became possible thanks to the introduction of the delimiter:.</p>
