<p><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_divider_simple_semicolon">sc.s-delimiter ;</sc_element> is allowed to use in <b><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence_7_level">sc.s-sentences of level 7</sc_element></b>  in all cases for which this delimiter is intended. More detailed rules for the use of the delimiter are discussed below in the section.</p>
<p>Rules defaults (not display) of delimiters <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code">SCs-code</sc_element>:</p>
<ol>
<li> After the delimiter ; the same image <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connectors</sc_element> are removed. For example, X -> r1: r2: Y; r3: Z;; display instead of X -> r1: r2: Y; -> r3: Z;;  </li>
<li> If after <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_divider_simple_semicolon">sc.s-delimiter ;</sc_element> present not only identical images of <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connectors</sc_element>, but also the same modifiers and connectors, their names are omitted. For example, X -> r1: r2: Y; Z;; instead of X -> r1: r2: Y; -> r1: r2: Z;;</li>
<li> The delimiter of built-in sentences (*...*)can removed if the built-in sentence doesn't contain a delimiter. For example, X -> r1: r2: Y => r3: Z;; instead of X -> r1: r2: Y(* => r3: Z *);; </li> 
</ol>
