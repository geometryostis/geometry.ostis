<p>Let's pay attention that in comparison with submission of the similar text in <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_code_5_level">SCs-code of level 5</sc_element>, this text contains difficult identifiers’ kind {…}, \[…\], \[*…*\], This allows to record explicitly a contents of some <sc_element sys_idtf  = "sc_link">sc-links</sc_element> within <sc_element sys_idtf  = "scs_text">a sc-text</sc_element>, more laconically to write sets from several elements, as well as to use the concept of <sc_element sys_idtf  = "scs_contour">sc.s-contour</sc_element> similar to <sc_element sys_idtf  = "scg_contour">sc.g-contour</sc_element>. </p>
