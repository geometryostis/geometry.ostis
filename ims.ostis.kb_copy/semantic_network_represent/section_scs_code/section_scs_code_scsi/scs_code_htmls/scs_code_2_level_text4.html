<p>The possibility of not to enter names for all <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connectors</sc_element> is provided in <b><sc_element sys_idtf="scs_sentence_2_level">sc.s-2 level sentences</sc_element></b>.</p>
<p>For this purpose we introduce <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_divider">sc.s-delimiters</sc_element>, which are images of <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connectors</sc_element> (e.g. ∍ ), as well as non-atomic IDs connectors type of (...).There is a table of <sc_element sys_idtf="scs_divider">sc.s-delimiters</sc_element> that are images <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_connector">sc-connectors</sc_element> below.</p>
<p>If there are multiples of connectors between some <sc_element sys_idtf="sc_element">sc-elements</sc_element>, suffixes are introduced, in order to avoid homonymy, for example (v1 -> v2)1, (v1 -> v2)2.</p>
<p>Using non-atomic identifiers such as <...>, {...}, \[* ... *\], \[...\] is not permitted.</p>
